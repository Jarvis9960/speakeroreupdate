                    <p>
                        We are very particular about ethical practices and anyone adopting such practices which may deem unfit by speakerore.com representatives can be blacklisted and their subscription cancelled with immediate effect. The decision of speakerore.com will be final and binding. These are very rare events and we are proud to say that the subscribers community we have are highly educated and ethical. We have not yet blacklisted any one and hope the situation does not arise in future.

                        30.         How does SpeakerOre handle, If a selected speaker does not show up to speak at the event?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We do not take any responsibility of the speaker or the event manager in any way. It is mutual decision between the two members. It is highly unlikely that a speaker does not turn up for the event without a valid reason. The subscribers at speakerore.com are professionals and serious about their speaking. However if a situation arises, we request the event managers to notify us and we shall apply our due diligence in the matter. In worst case scenario, the speaker will be blacklisted from our portal.
